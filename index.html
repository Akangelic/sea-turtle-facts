            <h2 class="facts-title" >Sea turtles lay their eggs in a nest they dig in the sand with their rear flippers </h2>
            <p class="facts-p"> They usually lay 100-125 eggs per nest and will nest multiple times, about two weeks apart, over several months. As soon as the eggs hatch (roughly 2 months later), the hatchlings dig out of their nest. This process generally takes a few days. Once they emerge, the tiny turtles hurry to the sea and make their way offshore into the open ocean. Sea turtles face many threats, but those that survive to become adults are decades old.</p>

            <h2 class="facts-title">There are seven existing types of sea turtles: </p>
            <p class="facts-p"> flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp's ridley, and olive ridley. Six of the seven sea turtle species, all but the flatback, are present in U.S. waters.</p>

            <h2 class="facts-title">Turtles Use Earth&apos;s Magnetic Field to Navigate</h2>
            <p  class="facts-p">Research shows that sea turtles can sense the strength and direction of the sun and Earth&apos;s magnetic field, which gives them a sense of where they are in the world.</p>

            <h2 class="facts-title">Leatherback sea turtles are as old as dinosaurs! </h2>
            <p  class="facts-p"> Sea turtles were around at the same time as dinosaurs! That&apos;s right, sea turtles as we know them today evolved 110 million years ago and have changed very little in the years since. </p>

            <h2 class="facts-title">Sand Temperature Determines the Sex of Sea Turtles </h2>
            <p  class="facts-p"> The temperature of the sand during the middle portion of the days that the sea turtle eggs incubate will determine whether the egg hatches a boy or a girl. 
            eggs that incubate at temperatures above 31ºC (87.8ºF) will produce 100% female sea turtles, whereas temperatures below 27.5º (81.5ºF) result in 100% male turtles. Nests that incubate between these temperatures will hatch a mix of male and female turtle babies. </p>
